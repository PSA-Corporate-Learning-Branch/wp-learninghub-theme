                    <p>If you are looking to develop online learning and do not have resources or an online course creation tool, we recommend visiting the <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=6D57CEBA7FA64B5AAF70938A89DB5628">CSA approved vendor list</a>.

                    <p>You may host learning on the Learning System that are created in online development tools like Storyline, Articulate Rise, PowerPoint, Podcasts, Videos and live sessions.
