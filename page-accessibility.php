            <p>Our virtual courses are designed to be interactive and engaging, using a mix of discussion, activities, and group collaboration. To help you prepare for the learning experience, here's what you can expect in a typical facilitated session.</p>
            <h4>Live sessions in Microsoft Teams or Zoom</h4>
            <p>Sessions are conducted in Microsoft Teams or Zoom, where you will join other participants and facilitators in a virtual classroom setting.</p>
            <h4>Breakout rooms for small group discussions</h4>
            <p>In some sessions, you may be placed in breakout rooms to collaborate with peers in smaller groups.</p>
            <h4>Live chat feature</h4>
            <p>The chat function will be available for asking questions, sharing insights, and engaging with others in real-time. You may not be required to track the live chat; when required, facilitator may prompt the class to do so.</p>
            <h4>Live transcript and captions</h4>
            <p>Automated transcripts and captions are enabled during sessions for accessibility and note-taking.</p>
            <h4>Facilitator-led discussions and interactive activities</h4>
            <p>Sessions may include polls, discussions, and exercises to reinforce learning.</p>
            <h4>Course materials and resources</h4>
            <p>Any relevant course materials or supplementary documents will be shared either before or during the session.</p>
